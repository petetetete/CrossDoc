CrossDoc is a comment management system that expands the documentation capabilities of teams and individuals. By separating *comments* from *code*, CrossDoc is able to optimize how and when you can edit your project's comments.


## Installation

CrossDoc can be installed through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) by using the following command:

`pip install cross-doc`

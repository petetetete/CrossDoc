1)  important an issue I encountered was the way atom implemented the config json.

    It ended up in C:\Users\~\AppData\Local\atom\app-1.24.0\

    try there if continuing to get no comment store error

2)  For some reason atom doesnt seem to run cdoc commands at first,

    use the reverseText to reverse some text then the other functions work file_name

    looking into the issue

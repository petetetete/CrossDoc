Git Hooks
=========

This is a developmental directory storing early iterations of our git hook 
integration

Installation
------------

To "install" a git hook in a particular repository, you would copy the file
into the ``.git\hooks\`` directory of your project. For example, to install
the ``pre-commit`` hook should be saved as ``.git\hooks\pre-commit``.
